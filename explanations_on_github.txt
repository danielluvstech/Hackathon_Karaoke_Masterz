Explanations on the Github repositories.

I worked on branches user sign up and song selection, new song management, and change song. 

Anania worked on queue management, performance log, and queue export json.

Unfortunately, we were running into trouble while trying to merge our branches, and decided that I'll commit all the files, 
but writing these notes here to let you know that Anania also deserves credit for what he did,
even though Github does not show it.
